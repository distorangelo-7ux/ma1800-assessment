                <h1>Hey there!</h1>
                <p>Thank you for visiting our home page, we're a duo of artists just trying to get by. We particularly like using digital technologies, and are excited to learn more about designing websites!</p>

                <p>As you can tell, our website is far from complete and we've been hard at work trying to display our works in here (short films, artworks, silly stuff). We currently only have this page, so definitely a lot of work to do!</p>

                <p>Apologies for the empty space! We'll upload our work and implement a newspage soon!!!</p>
