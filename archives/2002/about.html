                <h6>how do we even start with this?</h6>
                <p>
                    We're a silly duo of friends who met in secondary school and kicked it off as an art duo in the years to come. We like to think of ourselves as free spirits making fun artwork for others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We're excited to enter this digital space and gain recognition, just like some of our favourite artists! We're so lucky to live in a time where people can have their work be recognised around the world, as well as enjoying the million possibilities that the world-wide web can offer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal isn't to gain profit at all (though some would be nice, haha), but if a bigger studio is offering to help us in our efforts, then we'll definitely consider it!
                </p>

                <p>Thank you for reading! Whoever you are... As a gift, <a href="../../archivers_notes/fin.html">here's a teaser</a> for our upcoming project!</p>
