## Synopsis ##
A team of website archivists stumble upon a now-defunct 'placeholders.com', collecting a limited amount of snapshots across different points in time and creating a website dedicated to their findings.

The user must now navigate through these snapshots to uncover the truth behind the website, what it's about and who truly owns it.

It is implied through the text, however, that 'placeholders' used to consist of a freelance duo of artists, before being purchased by a company and losing their artistic freedom. A fit of rage causes them to vandalise the website with their own messages scattered across, wreaking havoc across the modern-day pages, and resurfacing their old pages.

### Commentary ###
This narrative was designed to highlight the commercialisation of art, and its potential chokehold on style and experimentalism - relying on safe, mainstream approaches to presenting ideas instead of expanding on the capabilities of what a website could do. I was particularly inspired by the history of the Smosh YouTube channel which, after being purchased, lost its creative freedom in favour of standardised content that follow successful formulas.

Browsing through the Web Design Museum made me realise that this applied to large companies as well, such as Cartoon Network, who have abandoned their experimentalism to follow the mainstream layout of modern websites (Note the differences between 2005 and 2020). So what I set out to do, essentially, was experiment with different web-design philosophies and play around with the features I learned about HTML / CSS to create a mixture of modern design philosophies, older design philosophies and "glitch" pages that play around with the ways one could style a page. 

I wanted to create a net.art project that served as a love letter to what websites are capable of as a medium, respecting the interplay between reading for information, interacting with elements and navigating through multiple dynamic pages, which I find to be the most unique features that a website could offer.

## How to navigate ##
The experience is divided into multiple parts:

### INTRO ###
To enter the website from the index, click on the 'latest snapshot archive' hyperlink in the introductory text.

As revealed in the 'help' section of the index, you must click on the placeholders logo multiple times until it has accessed the 4th page (the 5th page will tell the user to go back).

Scroll down and click the underlined 'creation' hyperlink, then click 'Accept All'.

### CORRUPTED PAGES ###
Clicking on 'MOVE ON' will open a separate page leading to the hallway of website elements. At the bottom of the page is an "a href" link that can be clicked to get to the next page.

As revealed in the hidden text below the information box, you must click on the 'FAUXGALLERY.HTML' hyperlink to proceed.

### GALLERY ###
2010s: Click on the right arrow box to proceed to the archivers' warning. Afterwards, click on 'Accept All'.

2009: Scroll down and click the orange arrow placed after 'on page 2 of 3'

### WAYBACK TV ###
Clicking on search will "change the channel", whereas "enter" will open a separate page according to the channel shown in the TV screen. The TV will switch between 4 channels.

STATIC: Landing page, clicking on enter will not do anything.
HOME: Clicking on enter will lead to the 2002 homepage.
ABOUT US: Clicking on enter will lead to the 2002 'about us' page.
ARTWORK: Clicking on enter will reveal a found artwork created by the original 'placeholders' duo. Clicking on search will take the user back to the landing page.

To reach the "ending", just go to the 2002 'about us' page through the TV and click on the 'here's a teaser' hyperlink to find the final page.

The net.art is concluded with a picture of the original placeholders duo, a 'teaser' of the humanity that created the original website.
