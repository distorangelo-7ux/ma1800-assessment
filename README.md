## SYNOPSIS ##
A team of website archivists stumble upon a now-defunct 'placeholders.com', collecting a limited amount of snapshots across different points in time and creating a website dedicated to their findings.

The user must now navigate through these snapshots to uncover the truth behind the website, what it's about and who truly owns it.

It is implied through the text, however, that 'placeholders' used to consist of a freelance duo of artists, before being purchased by a company and losing their artistic freedom. A fit of rage causes them to vandalise the website with their own messages scattered across, wreaking havoc across the modern-day pages, and resurfacing their old pages.

### COMMENTARY ###
This narrative was designed to highlight the commercialisation of art, and its potential chokehold on style and experimentalism - relying on safe, mainstream approaches to presenting ideas instead of expanding on the capabilities of what a website could do. I was particularly inspired by the history of the Smosh YouTube channel which, after being purchased, lost its creative freedom in favour of standardised content that follow successful formulas.

Browsing through the [Web Design Museum](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/) made me realise that this applied to large companies as well, such as Cartoon Network, who have abandoned their experimentalism to follow the mainstream layout of modern websites (Note the differences between [2005](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/cartoon-network-in-2005) and [2020](https://www.webdesignmuseum.org/gallery/cartoon-network-in-2020)). So what I set out to do, essentially, was experiment with different web-design philosophies and play around with the features I learned about HTML / CSS to create a mixture of modern design philosophies, older design philosophies and "glitch" pages that play around with the ways one could style a page. 

I wanted to create a net.art project that served as a love letter to what websites are capable of as a medium, respecting the interplay between reading for information, interacting with elements and navigating through multiple dynamic pages, which I find to be the most unique features that a website could offer.

## HOW TO NAVIGATE ##
The experience is divided into multiple parts:

### Intro ###
To enter the website from the index, click on the 'latest snapshot archive' hyperlink in the introductory text.

As revealed in the 'help' section of the index, you must click on the placeholders logo multiple times until it has accessed the 4th page (the 5th page will tell the user to go back).

Scroll down and click the underlined 'creation' hyperlink, then click 'Accept All'.

### Corrupted Pages ###
Clicking on 'MOVE ON' will open a separate page leading to the hallway of website elements. At the bottom of the page is an "a href" link that can be clicked to get to the next page.

As revealed in the hidden text below the information box, you must click on the 'FAUXGALLERY.HTML' hyperlink to proceed.

### Gallery ###
2010s: Click on the right arrow box to proceed to the archivers' warning. Afterwards, click on 'Accept All'.

2009: Scroll down and click the orange arrow placed after 'on page 2 of 3'

### Wayback TV ###
Clicking on search will "change the channel", whereas "enter" will open a separate page according to the channel shown in the TV screen. The TV will switch between 4 channels.

STATIC: Landing page, clicking on enter will not do anything.

HOME: Clicking on enter will lead to the 2002 homepage.

ABOUT US: Clicking on enter will lead to the 2002 'about us' page.

ARTWORK: Clicking on enter will reveal a found artwork created by the original 'placeholders' duo. Clicking on search will take the user back to the landing page.

To reach the "ending", just go to the 2002 'about us' page through the TV and click on the 'here's a teaser' hyperlink to find the final page.

## INSPIRATIONS & TECHNICAL RESEARCH ##
The different pages included different inspirations of mine, so they'll be explored as such.

### Comment on File Organisation ###
This project poses itself as an archival project, and I wanted to reflect that through its file organisation. The project is split between two folders: The archivers' notes and the archives themselves. The latter is more interesting as its subfolders are categorised by the years the snapshots were taken (2002, 2009, 2010s). 

### Intro ###
The index page pays homage to [the first website](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html), functionally and aesthetically, as I figured this would be a nice way of resonating with the history of the World Wide Web.

The 'first snapshot page' was designed with the intention of following more mainstream approaches to web-design, displaying the commercialisation of artistic websites. For this, I decided it would be best to follow a tutorial on creating 'professional-looking' websites, so I followed Brian Design's [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/FazgJVnrVuI) on creating a fully-responsive website, catered to beginners of HTML, CSS and Javascript (which I did not use). I struggled a lot with understanding the concepts behind the CSS used in the video, so I ended up copy-pasting code without truly understanding what each function did.

The function of having to navigate through 5 similar 
contact' pages was meant to replicate the experience of refreshing a website. This was a homage to one of my first exposures to digital art, [Username 666](https://youtu.be/7iFXyLah2oQ) by YouTube channel [nana825763](https://www.youtube.com/@nana825763), where a hidden channel is accessed by refreshing the page multiple times. I wanted to recreate the same feeling of suspense by having the users wait for the page to load, unsure of what will appear next.

"This site is not for you." is a direct reference to *House of Leaves* (Danielewski, 2001), which opens with "This is not for you.", written to alienate the user from a sense of belonging to the page. The 'Accept All' button is taken from the Terms & Conditions box to imply a corrupted part of the website.

### Corrupted Pages ###
The first corrupted page is just a further distortion of the initial contact page. A repeated background is used for the encompassing glitch effect, and I played around with margin and padding values to position elements in strange ways.

The page to follow this (1xwyvFD1foL) uses a layout heavily inspired by [wwwwwwwww.jodi.org](https://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org/) (1996, JODI), with floating elements scattered across the page and in front of a technical background. For this, I used the Opte Project's [2010 Internet Map](https://www.opte.org/the-internet) to create the feeling of navigating through the internet.

Afterwards, the third corrupted page (2Fc2rlpXHjx) was heavily inspired by [Keeping Up Appearances](https://blacknetart.com/keepingupappearances.html) (2001, Obadike), in that the initial text is deceptive, and the truth is revealed by hovering over the missing gaps. I followed this case study to highlight the conflict between placeholder's commercial present, and the freelancer's distaste for their lost freedom in the past.

### Gallery ###
The first gallery page takes users to the modern-day layout once more, but without the Terms and Conditions pop-up and with broken images. Clicking to the right leads to the archivers' note about their attempt to preserve the gallery pages.

The second gallery page consists of multiple images supplied by the now-unavailable image-sharing platform tinypic.com. This was inspired by my own experiences browsing the internet, as I would see old forum posts that no longer had their initial images due to the shutdown of tinypic. This page is an art piece showing the fragility of having to rely on external services, granted they can always be taken away from us.

The aesthetic of this page, as well as its index section is direct callback to [gifcities.org](https://gifcities.org/).

### Wayback TV ###
Arguably the most interesting section of my net.art piece. Having skimmed through Jennifer Niederst Robbins' 2001 *Learning Web Design*, I found an old technique where web-designers would use tables to display multi-pieced pictures, which meant that certain areas of the image can be changed without affecting the whole image.

I decided to use this technique in the form of a TV, which allowed users to search through different pages of the website and enter them one-by-one. In a sense, it is a portal to the real past of placeholders.com.

For this, I had to follow a tutorial on [how to split an image through GIMP](https://docs.gimp.org/3.0/en/plug-in-guillotine.html) and recap my knowledge on [creating tables](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp) through W3Schools.

I could not accurately follow the methods highlighted in Robbins' textbook as I did not have the software they were using and the HTML code they used seemed to be outdated. Instead, I had to use my own ideas to get images to appear in each cell of the table.

### 2002 Pages ###
Using Robbins' book once more, as well as inspiration from restorativland's [Geocities Gallery](https://geocities.restorativland.org/), I decided to create a more primitive-looking website. I did this by using tables to form the layout my page, as well as paying attention to the font used, the style of the logo and staying close to the approaches that were popular around the time of the early internet.

I was hoping that by dedicating a section of my art piece to older web-design, I could have users compare and contrast the attitudes between the enthusiasm fueling personalised websites of the past, and the standardised commercialisation of modern-day web-design. I tried as well to make the writing feel less corporate, as to show how grounded the artists were around this time.

The net.art is concluded with a picture of the original placeholders duo, a 'teaser' of the humanity that created the original website.

If I had more time, I would have loved to create more fun web-pages such as the ['Catch the Kirby'](https://distorangelo-7ux.github.io/ma1800-assessment/archives/2002/artworks/3oYa86n2cez.html) section of 2002 placeholder. These pages would not only have characterised the original placeholder duo, but it would have also shown the capability for fun and entertainment that websites truly have.
