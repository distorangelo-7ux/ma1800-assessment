    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>NOTE: The information below is solely speculation, based on what little information we could find from the website and <span class="fakelink">some forum posts</span> .</p>
    <p>placeholder.com was a website owned by a studio specialising in creating art commissions. For unknown reasons, it was <span class="fakelink">vandalised and ultimately wrecked</span> by a <span class="fakelink">third-party</span>, individual or not we do not know as of yet.</p>
    <p>There are <span class="fakelink">some claims</span> saying the website remained this way until the company's inevitable demise.</p>
